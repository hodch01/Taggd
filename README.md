## Description

Taggd is an easy-to-use and lightweight widget that creates configurable photo tags to your images with / without a popup.

## Configuration

To configure and use the Taggd widget, it must be placed inside a data view, as the widget requries an object for it to work. 

There are two key configurables:

Image to be taggd - Select a static image from your project to manipluate (Dynamic images will be avaliable in future releases)

Store attribute - Select an attribute where the string representation of your taggd notes will be stored, (Needs to be unlimited) 

Taggd notes are stored in a string format and are parsed inside the widget to the image represenation your see on the screen.
